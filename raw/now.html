                <p>I'm in my sophomore year at Notre Dame now. Haven't been writing very much lately.</p>
                <p>This fall I've been taking Data Structures, Probability, Systems Programming, Logic Design, and Discrete Math. I enjoy these classes a lot.</p>
                <p>I feel a bit like I'm in a state of limbo. It is okay; you wouldn't call it limbo if you thought it was the end. A while back, I stepped on an escalator and my heels were separated from the ground. The past feeds on itself and I stand in motion. It is okay; my feet stayed on the stair after all. If I stand straight and lean forward a bit the rest of me will stay too. And so I wait expectantly, for the contact of my heels. Take a step! There is no one behind me but I feel like I must hurry. For the contact of my heels. Do you ever feel that to move is to deny yourself some kind of satisfaction? The escalator is long and my feet are tired. But in twisted thoughts where everything must be manufactured by the self, wouldn't you believe that movement precludes faith? I guess we all need someone to catch us.<p>
                <p>I will have some notes and projects that should be posted before the end of the year. I might be back in Colorado for some time in the spring.</p>
                <p>A song I liked today: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSuSXIMh46A">Shida Shahabi - Petula</a></p>
