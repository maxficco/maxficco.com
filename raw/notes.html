                <p>Not a lot yet...I still need to figure out how I want to render markdown files on here...</p>
                <p>For now, I just uploaded some linear algebra notes from last year. See <a href="/notes/linear_algebra/LinearAlgebra.md">this page</a>. I index most of my notes by linked text files.  They are nice to navigate in vim/obsidian -- I really like the loose non-hierarchical structure and the freedom to present groups of files among text.  But I probably will need some folders at some point.  And browsers don't support markdown links, so it's not super robust. Maybe real-time markdown->html?  Maybe a static converter?  Lots of design choices to be made; I don't want to keep two separate versions of each note I make online/locally, but I also want it to be stable and nice to read on the web.  Will try to work on it in the near future!  For now you can find the pdfs under /notes/linear_algebra/20610_MM_DD.pdf.</p>
