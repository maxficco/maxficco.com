                <p>I'm back home now for about a month before the fall semester.  I spent almost 9 weeks at Notre Dame getting a really fun (and surprisingly hands-off) introduction to the world of academic cs research!  Super grateful for our program coordinator, our group's mentor, and all the cool people I got to meet!</p>

                <p>Currently planning to try out some new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03613">techniques</a> in a 2D Gaussian Splatting video compression project (coarse+fine deformation)</p>
                <p>Also continuing to follow <a href="https://karpathy.ai">Andrej Karpathy</a>'s wonderful tutorials on youtube :D</p>

                <p>Learning/working on 2D Gaussian Splatting for image&video compression</p>
                <p>I need to write and create more but my mind and soul are still a little sick</p>

                <p>I am currently studying for finals!  The weather has been much happier lately.  My eyes are red and puffy and full of pollen, but oh man, spring is so nice here! Having grown up in Denver, I think I am unaccustomed to such discrete seasons as those in the Midwest.  The solid three months of miserable, gray cold were spent without expectation of this pleasantly gradual warmth.  Back home, it snows most in March and April, and I guess I just tended to wake up on some day in late May and start calling it summer.  I am excited for summer's warm green light and heavy leaves, and I guess that itchy anticipation is what spring is all about.</p>
                <p>Here is a picture of some late April trees:</p>

                <p>This semester, I've been helping contribute to a research project on LLM agent simulations.  This summer, I will be back at Notre Dame for a different project on image compression!</p>
                <p>I've been watching some very cool tutorials by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0&list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ">Andrej Karpathy</a> that I hope to continue with this summer.  I'm making <a href="https://github.com/maxficco/micrograd.c">micrograd.c</a> as a final project in my cs class!</p>
                <p><i>From A Basement On The Hill</i> by Elliott Smith has been one of my favorite albums to listen to lately.  I don't remember liking it as much in the past, but for some reason I now have a great appreciation for it.</p>
