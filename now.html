            <h3>### What I'm doing now</h3>
            <blockquote>> April 2025</blockquote>
            <p>I am currently studying for finals!  The weather has been much happier lately.  My eyes are red and puffy and full of pollen, but oh man, spring is so nice here! Having grown up in Denver, I think I am unaccustomed to such discrete seasons as those in the Midwest.  The solid three months of miserable, gray cold were spent without expectation of this pleasantly gradual warmth.  Back home, it snows most in March and April, and I guess I just tended to wake up on some day in late May and start calling it summer.  I am excited for summer's warm green light and heavy leaves, and I guess that itchy anticipation is what spring is all about.</p>
            <p>Here is a picture of some late April trees:</p>

            <li>This semester, I've been helping contribute to a research project on LLM agent simulations.  This summer, I will be back at Notre Dame for a different project on image compression!</p>
            <li>I've been watching some very cool tutorials by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0&list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ">Andrej Karpathy</a> that I hope to continue with this summer.</p>
            <li><i style="margin:0">From A Basement On The Hill</i> by Elliott Smith has been one of my favorite albums to listen to lately.  I don't remember liking it as much in the past, but for some reason I now have a great appreciation for it.</p>
