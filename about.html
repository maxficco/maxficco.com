                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hi, I'm Max!  I am a 19 year old student from Colorado.  I went to Regis Jesuit High School and I'm currently at the University of Notre Dame, where I'm studying computer science and math.  Unsurprisingly, I'm a big fan of computers.  I'm hoping to use this website to share projects and thoughts, because there are so many interesting things that I'd like to do and always a surprising number of dilemmas to be worked out in words.</p>
                <p>Some more interests of mine include running, hiking, playing piano, speedcubing, thrifting, skiing, and taking photos.  I also enjoy reading and writing (journaling), but often only in times when I'm able to force myself to.  So many of the things I do are like giving a cat a bath.  I've never owned a cat, but I've heard that once they're finally wet they no longer hate the water.</p>
